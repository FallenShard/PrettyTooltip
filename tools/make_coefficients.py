"""Writes Data/SpellRanks.lua: every class spell rank's spell power
coefficients and the level it is learned at, by spell ID.

The numbers come from a WoW Forever spell database, which
tools/forever_spells.py builds from the client's own spell tables on
wago.tools, with the scaling Blizzard's development notes state the client
lacks. For each ability rank it lists the effects that carry its scaling,
those of the spells it triggers (a missile, an area tick) included, as direct
or periodic, and as damage, healing, or an absorb. Pet spells and the physical
classes are left out. EXTRA adds the spells the database lacks, by hand.
